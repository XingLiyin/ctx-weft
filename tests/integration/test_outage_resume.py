"""End-to-end: transient LLM outage interrupts a session; /resume re-drives to completion.

Two invariants:
1. After outage: task is SUSPENDED (non-terminal), NOT FAILED; the root agent goes
   ``interrupted`` (AgentInterrupted emitted).
2. After resume with healthy LLM: task reaches FINISHED; agent not left interrupted.
3. Idempotent: a second outage+resume cycle behaves identically; final resume completes.

Task 16 note: ``SessionInterrupted`` (and the SessionRegistry state machine that used to
emit it) is retired — the SM was demoted to a plain agent registry in Task 15. These
assertions now pin the agent-level ALM verdict (``AgentInterrupted`` / ``status_of() ==
"interrupted"``) instead: TaskInterrupted (the task-domain fact TaskManager still emits
on this exact path) drives the ALM five-state machine the same way TaskQueueInterrupted
used to drive SM, so the observation point moves down one layer without losing strength.
The event-store projection's ``session_status`` can no longer reach ``INTERRUPTED``
either (nothing emits the retired event to drive that reducer branch any more), so this
file stops asserting on it — an accepted consequence of session-state ownership moving
to the host (docs/events-v2.md §2.1.1), not a regression.

API contract (confirmed by reading runtime.py):
- ``start_session(params)`` → ``RunHandle``; emits SESSION_CREATED so the event store can
  be queried by ``recover_session``.  ``run_single_task`` is a phase-1 compat shim that
  does NOT emit SESSION_CREATED, making ``recover_session`` fail with "not found".
- ``handle.wait_for_finish(timeout)`` streams events until RunFinished (or timeout).
- ``recover_session(session_id)`` → ``None``; re-queues non-terminal tasks and launches
  drain as ``asyncio.create_task`` (fire-and-forget).
- Task status and session status are read back via ``rebuild_view`` from the event store.

Self-heal budget note
--------------------
``stream_llm_resilient`` reads budget config from ``ctx.config`` (the LoopContext).
We inject ``RuntimeConfig(llm_self_heal_max_attempts=1, ...)`` into ``make_runtime(config=...)`` directly.
This also proves the production wiring: if ``ctx.config`` were still ``None``, the 8-attempt / 2s-base-delay
defaults would make these tests take minutes instead of completing instantly.
